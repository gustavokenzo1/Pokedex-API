# Pokedex API

This project was created with the goal of understanding what skills future trainees at Orc'estra Gamificação will have to apply and learn during their trainee process!

This project uses:
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/)

This project can be tested on https://gustavokenzo1.github.io/Pokedex-API/

## Goals

This project will be given to them as a challenge, after they have completed their React curriculum. That's why we are using an external API, so that they get in touch with concepts such as connecting to a REST API and making requisitions, to show the information received on the front-end, without them having to create their own back-end.

## What they'll learn

- Improve skills from the first project (ReactJS, HTML, CSS)
- Basic React Hooks (useState, useEffect), so they can manipulate states (store and updated information)
- Use external libraries (such as axios) to connect to the API (although they don't need to use an external library, axios is recommended, since it's what we use)
- Async functions to wait for the requisitions
- Display information saved on a state on the page itself (such as the pokémon name)
